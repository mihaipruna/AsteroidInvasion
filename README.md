# AsteroidInvasion
Asteroid Invasion is a Java space game created with Processing.

It's the year 2012 and it looks like the world might indeed end in this fateful year. For in 2012 a huge swarm of asteroids crosses path with Earth! It is up to you to save the human race from certain extinction. Use nuclear thrusters, laser space stations and nuclear warheads to deflect or destroy incoming asteroids. Although this is an arcade game, Newtonian physics and the laws of motion are represented. Asteroids incur Earth's gravitational pull, but if they are fast enough they can end up orbiting forever or escape from Earth's gravity well. Using nuclear thrusters that ground and spit the asteroid's mass away from its body, you can 'help' these interplanetary interlopers depart Earth without causing any harm. Or you can destroy them ...  if  you build weapons!
Only you can prevent the extinction of the human race and restore peace in the sky!
