A red circle around the asteroid signifies it is in range and the red line shows the direction of the force imparted by the thruster if placed at that moment. Thrusters are free and are built automatically, but only ten at most are available at any time.<br>Right click on an asteroid &nbsp;to place a warhead on the asteroid (if any warheads are &nbsp;available)<br>Click on the BUILD button under &quot;Warheads&quot; to build a warhead. Warheads cost $5 Billion.<br>Click on the BUILD button under &quot;Stations&quot; to build a laser space station. Laser space stations automatically fire at asteroids. Up to four space stations can be built and each costs $10 Billion.</span></font> </div><br><br>      <div><font color="#339900"><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:17px;">Asteroid Invasion is a Java Space Game created with</span></font><a href="http://www.processing.org" target="_blank"><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:17px;"> Processing</span></a><font color="#339900"><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:17px;"> . It's the year 2012 and it looks like the world might indeed end in this fateful year. For in 2012 a <br soft>huge swarm of asteroids crosses path with Earth! It is up to you to save the human race from certain extinction. Use nuclear thrusters, laser space stations and <br soft>nuclear warheads to deflect or destroy incoming asteroids. Although this is an arcade game, Newtonian physics and the laws of motion are represented. Asteroids <br soft>incur Earth's gravitational pull, but if they are fast enough they can end up orbiting forever or escape from Earth's gravity well. Using nuclear thrusters that ground <br soft>and spit the asteroid's mass away from its body, you can 'help' these interplanetary interlopers depart Earth without causing any harm. Or you can destroy them ... &nbsp;if &nbsp;<br soft>you build weapons!<br></span></font><b><font color="#339900"><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:17px;">Only you can prevent the extinction of the human race and restore peace in the sky!<br></span></font><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><span style="font-size:20px;line-height:24px;">	  <br><br>	  Tips<br></span></font><font color="#FF0000"><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:17px;">Asteroids that are moving fast are less of a threat that slow ones, unless their path takes them straight to Earth. Due to their high velocity, they are less affected by <br soft>Earth's gravitational pull.<br>Use thrusters not against the path of the asteroid, but rather trying to accelerate it both tangentially and away from Earth. However, small asteroids can be completely <br soft>devoured by the thruster that is using their mass as reaction force, thus it might be advantageous to slow them down until they vanish.<br>Nuclear warheads can split large asteroids, causing twice the headache. Try to use the warheads as far from Earth as possible on large asteroids.<br>The higher your population, the faster cash accrues. A civilization near extinction obviously cannot produce as much as a healthy one.<br soft></span></font></span>      </div>
